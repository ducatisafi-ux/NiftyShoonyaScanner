# NiftyShoonyaScanner (Demo Mode)

This is a **personal-use** Android app project (Kotlin) that shows a daily options plan (CALL/PUT) using simple, conservative rules.

✅ Works out of the box in **Demo mode**.

⚠️ Shoonya (Finvasia / Noren) live API wiring is **not implemented** in this starter version. You can still store your Shoonya credentials locally (encrypted) via **Settings** so you can add the API calls later.

## What you can do now
- Open the app
- Tap **Refresh** to see a plan (demo values)
- Go to **Settings** and save Shoonya details (optional now)

## Build APK without Android Studio (GitHub Actions)
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload this project.
2. Go to **Actions** tab...
